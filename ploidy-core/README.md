# ploidy-core

This crate is the core (or nucleus! 🧬) of the [Ploidy](https://crates.io/crates/ploidy) OpenAPI code generator. It exposes structures for parsing OpenAPI types, and code generators for different languages.

You can use **ploidy-core** as part of a larger project, or from a [build script](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html) if you're targeting Rust.
