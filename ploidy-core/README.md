# ploidy-core

This crate is the nucleus (🧬) of the [Ploidy](https://crates.io/crates/ploidy) OpenAPI code generator. It exposes structures for constructing a language-agnostic **intermediate representation** of an OpenAPI spec, which code generators then use to target different languages.

⚠️ The **ploidy-core** API isn't stable yet.
