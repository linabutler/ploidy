# ploidy-pointer-derive

This crate provides a derive macro for automatically implementing the `JsonPointee` trait from the **ploidy-pointer** crate. For more details about how the macro works, and how to customize the derived implementation, please [see the crate docs](https://docs.rs/ploidy-pointer-derive).

**Note:** You typically don't need to depend on this crate directly. Instead, please use **ploidy-pointer**, and enable its `derive` feature.
