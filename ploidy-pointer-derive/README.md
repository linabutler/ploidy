# ploidy-pointer-derive

This crate provides a derive macro for automatically implementing the `JsonPointee` trait from the `ploidy-pointer` crate.

**Note:** You typically don't need to depend on this crate directly. Instead, please use the `ploidy-pointer` crate with the `derive` feature (enabled by default).
